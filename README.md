## [Junior Web Developer](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/48-developpeur-web-junior) - Project 1

The site must fit on a page with a menu that remains visible at the top of the page, even when you move in the page.

The expected sections are:
-  A first welcoming welcome screen, very visual  
-  The list of services offered by the agency  
-  Examples of projects already completed  
-  A card with a contact form (we do not ask you to run the form, just display it)  

The site will be made in **HTML** & **CSS** (without framework such as Bootstrap).

The only JavaScript used is Grunt, the TaskRunner to :
-  concat CSS with banner, footer & Normalize
-  add webkit with autoprefixer
-  make the CSS min file
